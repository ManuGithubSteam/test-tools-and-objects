This gcode file is a demonstration (and very helpful tool) of the Prusa Firmware enhanced M860 command - which will be available in the upcoming firmware release AFTER 3.2.1 - M860 now waits also for the PINDA to cool down. The Gcode file prints six squares with each of the PINDA starting temperatures of 35C, 40C, 45C, 50C, 55C, and 60C all on the same print bed. You can easily see, if your ustep offsets in the EEPROM are consistent by inspecting the quality of each first layer.
